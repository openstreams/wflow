<p>The wflow_delwaq module provides a set of functions to construct a
delwaq pointer file from a PCRaster local drainage network.
A command-line interface is provide that allows you to
create a delwaq model that can be linked to a wflow model.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/ldd-rhine.png"><img alt="_images/ldd-rhine.png" src="_images/ldd-rhine.png" style="width: 640px;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The script sets-up a one-layer model (representing the kinematic wave
reservoir). Water is labeled according to the area and flux where it
enters the kinematic wave reservoir.</p>
<p>For the script to work a run of the wflow model must be available and a
template directory in which the delwaq model is created should also be
available. These are indicated by the -C -R and -D command line
options. The -R and -C options indicate the wflow case and wflow run
directories while the -D option indicates the delwaq template
directory.</p>
<p>The template used is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>debug/

delwaq1.exe
delwaq2.exe

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The debug, includes_flow, and includes_deltashell directories are
filled by the script. After that delwaq1.exe and delwaq2.exe programs
may be run (the run.bat file shows how this is done):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>delwaq1.exe deltashell.inp -np
delwaq2.exe deltashell.inp
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the script sets up delwaq such that the result for the wflow gauges locations
are stored in the deltashell.his file.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-the-script-works">
<h2>How the script works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-the-script-works" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The pointer file for delwaq is made using the following information:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The wflow_ldd.map files is used to create the internal flow network,
it defines the segments and how water flows between the segments</li>
<li>The number of inflows into each segment determines is taken
from the sources mapstacks (-S option). Together these sources
should include all the water that enters the kinematic wave
reservoir. These are the red and green arrows in the figure below</li>
<li>The delwaq network is generated for the area define in the
wflow_catchment map. The included area is define by all cells were the
catchment id in a cel is larger than 1.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/delwaq-exchanges.png"><img alt="_images/delwaq-exchanges.png" src="_images/delwaq-exchanges.png" style="width: 640px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure: How exchanges and inflows are connected</p>
</div>
<p>Within the includes_flow directory the following files are made:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>volume.dat - volumes (N+1) noseg</li>
<li>flow.dat - flows (N). Contents is noq</li>
<li>area.dat - N timesteps. Content is noq</li>
<li>surface.dat - surface area of the water per segment (N+1), noseq</li>
<li>length.dat - One timestep only (constant). Content is two times noq</li>
</ul>
<p>Here nrseg is the number of segments (taken from the non-missing grid
cell in the wflow_ldd.map file) and noq is the number of exchanges which
is calculated as the number of segments plus number the of inflows
(in each segment) times the number of segments</p>
<p>Delwaq expects volumes to be instantanious values at the start of a
timestes while flows are integrated between tow timesteps. For volumes
N+1 timesteps are needed, for flows N timesteps.  The figure below
demonstrates this principle for N=4.</p>
<p class="graphviz">
<img src="_images/graphviz-55e9276bcbec583e24cbb0e4e042a9cbadc61776.png" alt="digraph Flows {

}" />
</p>
<p>The volume.dat file is filled with N+1 steps of volumes of the wflow
kinematic wave reservoir. To obtain the needed lag between the flows and
the volumes the volumes are taken from the kinematic wave reservoir one
timestep back (OldKinWaveVolume).</p>
<p>The flow.dat files is filled as follows. For each timestep internal
flows (within the kinematic wave reservoir, i.e. flows from segment to
segment) are written first (blue in the layout above). Next the flow
into each segment are written. Depending on how many inflow types are
given to the script (sources). For one type, one set of flows is
written, if there are two types two sets etc (green and red in the
layout above).</p>

<h1>Case study for Malaysia and Singapore<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-for-malaysia-and-singapore" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To estimate load of different nutrients to Johor strait two wflow_sbm models
have been setup. Next these models where linked to delwaq as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A delwaq segment network similar to the wflow D8 ldd was made</li>
<li>The volumes in the delwaq segment are taken from the wflow_sbm
kinematic wave volumes</li>
<li>For each segment two sources (inflows) are constructed, fast and slow
each representing different runoff compartments from the wflow model.
Fast represents SOF <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>, HOF <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a> and SSSF <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[3]</a> while Slow represent
groundwater flow.</li>
<li>Next the flow types are combined with the available land-use classes.
As such a Luclass times flowtypes matrix of constituents is made.
Each constituent (e.g. Slow flow of LU class 1) is traced troughout
the system. All constituents are conservative and have a
concentration of 1 as they flow in each segement.</li>
<li>To check for consistency an Initial water type and a Check water
type are introduced. The Initial water will leave the system gradually
after a cold start, the Check water type is added to each flow
component and should be 1 at each location in the system (Mass Balance
Check).</li>
</ol>

<p>The above results in a system in which the different flow types (including
the LU type where they have been generated) can be traced throughout the
system. Each each gauge location the discharge and the flow components
that make up the discharge are reported.</p>

</div>
<p>By assuming each flow type is an end-member in a mixing model we can add
fixed concentration of real parameters to the flow fractions and multiply
those with the concentrations of the end-membesrt modelled concentration
at the gauge locations can be obtained for each timestep.</p>

overland flow. SOF = Saturation overland flow, GW = exfiltrating

areas means that both SOF and GW can occur before a cell is
completely saturated.</p>
</div>
<p>The figure above shows the flow types in the models used in Singapore and
Malaysia. Groundwater flow (both from completely saturated cell and
subcell groundwater flow) makes up the Slow flow that is fed into the delwaq
model while SOF and HOF make up the Fast flow to the delwaq model. In addition
the water is also labelled according to the landuse type of the cell that
it flows out off.</p>
<p>The whole procedure was setup in a Delft-FEWS configuration that can run
the following steps operationally:</p>

model. This can be a landuse map, a subcatchment map etc. Furthermore water
can also be tagged based on the flux into the model.</p>

-a: Also write dynamic area data if this option is set
-j: if this option is set the static data is not generated (default is on)

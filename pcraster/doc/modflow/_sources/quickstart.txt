Quickstart
==========
The PCRasterModflow subdirectory of the demo directory includes a PCRcalc and a Python script both rebuilding the same example problem given in the user guide of MODFLOW-2000 (Open file report 00-92).

Run the example with

.. code-block:: bash

   pcrcalc -f example.mod

or

.. code-block:: bash

   python example.py




..
   Windows
   
   Ensure that you installed a current version of pcrcalc
   (version from June 2007 or later, available from
   <ulink url="http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcrwin32/index.html">http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcrwin32/index.html</ulink>). Executing pcrcalc
   without arguments shows the version information of your installed executable.
   
   Download the installer from the website and follow the guided setup. Select the PCRaster application directory (e.g. C:\PCRaster\apps) or a directory included in your PATH environment variable as installation directory for the extension.
